# Readable App

Readable is a content and comment web app. Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

Built on top of the [starter template](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter) for the final assessment project for Udacity's React & Redux course, developed by [React Training](https://reacttraining.com). 

## Quickstart

1. Clone/Download the repo: inside the folder you will find 2 subfolder, one for the backend server `/api-server` and one for the frontend `/frontend`
2. `cd` into each of the two subfolders and run `npm install` to download and install their respective dependencies
3. Start the server, from the root folder run the command `cd api-server/` and then `node server`
4. Start the frontend, from the root folder run the command `cd frontend/` and then `npm start`

`localhost:3000` should open in a browser tab/window
